# Reece-Win10-Quick-Start
Some PowerShell scripts to help me quickly get working on a new windows install

**Planned** | implemented

## On the old system
* Backing up currently installed Chocolately packages into a log file
* Using a test script to boot up a Windows Sandbox instance to test the main script out safely away from my main machine in case things go boom (and also to test software installs that would obviously already exist on my main machine)

## On the new system
* Installing chocolatey
* Using log file to reinstall all software
* Enabling Windows Sandbox as a Windows feature
* Enabling WSL & installing Ubuntu
